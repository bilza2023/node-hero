Hereâ€™s a clean write-up you can drop into your Node-Hero project. This will anchor your architectural thinking and onboard future contributors.

## ðŸ§  Service Layer Philosophy â€” Node-Hero

### ðŸ“Œ What Are Services?

In Node-Hero, **services are the only place where database logic is allowed**.

> A **service** is a JS module that wraps Prisma queries and handles all business logic related to a specific resource (e.g., Question, Chapter, Exercise).

Instead of spreading database code across routes, views, or helpers, we isolate all logic in reusable service files.

---

### ðŸ§± Directory Structure

```
services/
  questionService.js
  chapterService.js
  exerciseService.js
  tcodeService.js
```

Each file contains:

* Direct calls to `prisma.*`
* Data validation or joins (if needed)
* Reusable exports for use across routes, CLI, scripts, etc.

---

### ðŸ§ª Why We Do This

1. âœ… **Clean Routes**
   Routes/controllers stay thin â€” just take input, call service, and return output.

2. âœ… **Safe Refactoring**
   If Prisma changes, only services need updates â€” routes and views remain untouched.

3. âœ… **Easy Testing**
   Services can be tested without Express or HTTP â€” just call functions and check results.

4. âœ… **Future-Proofing**
   Moving to another DB or framework later? You only rework services.

### ðŸ›  Example

#### Service File â€” `services/questionService.js`

```js
const prisma = require('../db');

async function createQuestion(data) {
  return prisma.question.create({ data });
}

async function getQuestionById(id) {
  return prisma.question.findUnique({
    where: { id },
    include: { exercise: true }
  });
}

module.exports = { createQuestion, getQuestionById };
```

#### Router â€” `routes/question.js`

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { createQuestion } = require('../services/questionService');

router.post('/question', async (req, res) => {
  const q = await createQuestion(req.body);
  res.redirect(`/question/${q.id}`);
});
```

---

### ðŸ”’ Rule of Thumb

> **Only services are allowed to talk to Prisma.**
> Everyone else â€” routes, views, helpers â€” must go through a service.

---

### ðŸ§  Naming Convention

For every resource:

* `questionService.js` (not `questions.js`, to avoid conflict with routes)
* All CRUD and helper logic in one file
* Routes simply `require()` and delegate

---

Use this pattern across the entire `node-hero` app to keep logic clean, portable, and robust.
